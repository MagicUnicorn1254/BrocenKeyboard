    "how other people have persevered through their own trials and tribulations.",
    "SpongeBob SquarePants is friendly, optimistic, and loyal. His character\n"
    "was based on Charlie Chaplin, Jerry Lewis, Laurel and Hardy, and Pee\n"

    "Hey, if I close my eyes, it doesn't seem so dark.' This quote was said\n"
    "by SpongeBob in the thirty-fifth episode in the first season called\n"

    "side cements their relationship as friends rather than just colleagues\n"

    "of 212 wpm. Blackburn, who failed her QWERTY typing class in high school\n"
    "first encountered the Dvorak keyboard in 1938, quickly learned to achieve\n"
    "very high speeds, and occasionally toured giving speed-typing demonstrations\n"
    "during her secretarial career. She appeared a Late Night with David\n"
    "Letterman on January 24, 1985, but felt that Letterman made a spectacle\n"
    "of her. Blackburn died in April 1st 2008.",
    "One study examining 30 subjects, of varying different styles and expertise,\n"
    "has found minimal difference in typing speed between touch typists and\n"
    "self-taught hybrid typists. According to the study, 'The number of fingers\n"
    "does not determine typing speed... People using self-taught typing strategies\n"
    "were found to be as fast as trained typists... instead of the number of\n"
    "fingers, there are other factors that predict typing speed... fast typists...\n"
    "keep their hands fixed on one position, instead of moving them hands fixed on\n"
    "one position, instead of moving them over the keyboard, and more consistently\n"
    "use the same finger to type a certain letter.' To quote doctoral candidate Anna\n"
    "Feit: 'We were surprised to observe that people who took a typing course,\n"
    "performed at similar average speed and accuracy, as those that taught typing\n"
    "to themselves and only used 6 fingers on average.'",
